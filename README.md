## Usage

### Running Locally

Start the bot:
```sh
python -m src.main
```

The bot will:
1. Monitor r/soccer for new Premier League goal posts
2. Extract video links and check for duplicates
3. Post updates to Discord with direct MP4 links when possible

### Testing

Run the test suite:
```sh
# Windows
.\run_tests.ps1

# Linux/Mac
./run_tests.sh
```

Test specific functionality:
```python
# Test posts from last X hours
python -m src.main --test-hours 24

# Test specific Reddit threads
python -m src.main --test-threads "abc123,xyz789"

# Test with duplicate checking disabled
python -m src.main --ignore-duplicates
```

## Logging

The bot uses structured logging with clear status indicators:
- `[INFO]` - General information and successful operations
- `[SKIP]` - Posts that were skipped with reason
- `[DUPLICATE]` - Detailed duplicate detection information

Logs include:
- Timestamps
- Reddit and video URLs
- Processing status and decisions
- Duplicate detection details
